# MatMap

In this project I coded a website attached to a small database.
I filled the database with datasets found on Kaggle that hold specific data about countries (GDP worldwide, Estimated population...) 

The website takes the shape of a game, for each round the website display a cloropleth map made from an entry of the database, colouring all the countries.

The user has to guess which data has been selected based on the map displayed and the 4 options available

For example, a map of the estimated population of all the countries

They is also a light theme and other colour available for the maps
